# Variables in Java

> A variable is a name which is associated with a value that can be changed. For example when I write int i=10; here variable name is i which is associated with value 10, int is a data type that represents that this variable can hold integer values. You will find the details about data types in the further section. 
> <br><br>In Java, there are different <b>types of variables</b>, for example:
<br><ul>
    <li>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
    <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
    <li>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
    <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
    <li>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
</ul>

### Declaring a vairiable

> You must declare all variables before they can be used. Following is the basic form of a variable declaration âˆ’
> <br> <br><b> Syntax: </b> <i>type variableName = value;</i>
> <br><br> Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

#### Example; 


```Java
String name = "Ramesh";
System.out.println(name);
```

    Ramesh


#### Example; 


```Java
int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

    15


> You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

#### Example; 


```Java
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

    15



> <b>Note that </b> if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

#### Example; 


```Java
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);
```

    20



## Final Variables

> If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

#### Example: 


```Java
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable

    cannot assign a value to final variable myNum

     myNum = 20
        ^     ^
```
## Other Types
> A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:

#### Example:


```java
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello";
```
